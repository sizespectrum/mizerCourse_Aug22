While the course only starts on Monday the 8th of August, if you like you can already start preparations:

1\) You can [install the tools](install-tools.qmd) that we will use in the course.

2\) We assume that are familiar with the basics of R programming. There are plenty of free resources to learn R. You can look through [R studio resources](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/), go through [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) or explore multiple other tools. You can also share your favourite tutorials or resources in the comments below.

3\) You can familiarise with how we will be [using Git and GitHub](use-git-and-github.qmd) in this course for collaboration and feedback on your coursework. "Happy git with R" https://happygitwithr.com/ is a useful resource

4\) You can [introduce yourself](introduce-yourself.qmd) and your interests to your fellow participants.

That will allow for a flying start to the course. You won't believe how much we are looking forward to meeting you all on the 8th of August
