There are plenty of free resources to learn R. You can look through [R studio resources](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/), go through [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) or explore multiple other tools. You can also share your favourite tutorials or resources in the comments below.\n\nThat will allow for a flying start to the course. You won't believe how much we are looking forward to meeting you all on the 8th of August\n",
