We will first use an example to describe how to run your model with changing fishing, as well show how some of the outputs of the model can be analysed. Then you can use your model examine the consequences of simple changes in both resources and fishing.\n\n### Lecture\n\nThis week's contributor is Julia Blanchard. Her lecture provides a broad overview of the different ways in which mizer is being used to help understand the consequences of change in aquatic ecosystems. There are a lot of ways! The material describes how you can set model simulations to study change, some of which are explored in further detail below.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-1_51763877488a2adad2a400a9a2b3d298'}\n\n:::\n\n\n### Tutorials\n\nUsing examples, the tutorials are designed to help you develop your own model simulation experiments, in the following four stages:\n\n1.  [**Tuning the sensitivity to fishing**](tune-sensitivity.qmd)\\\n    First, we will explore how sensitive your model is to the effects of fishing. As usual, we will start with an example system. We will show how the reproduction parameters influence how sensitive the model is to changes in mortality. We can make adjustments and refinements at this step if the model does not produce realistic responses to fishing intensity.\n\n2.  [**Simulating and examining changes**](simulate-change.qmd)\\\n    Once the sensitivity to fishing is examined, we can assess how the model responds to changes in fishing through time. This step involves looking a bot closer at the fishing parameters in mizer and setting up a time-varying fishing effort. In this part we will start with an example that will show you how to run a model through a time series and compare it with data. You will then be able to explore how changes in reproduction, fishing and other parameters affect response to fishing through time.\n\n3.  [**Run your own scenarios**](run-your-own-scenarios.qmd)\\\n    In this tutorial we will explore how to set up your own fishing experiments and scenarios. These can be scenarios that compare different levels of fishing or a comparison of different future scenario projections, where fishing changes through time.\n\n\n4.  [**Changing resources**](change-resources.qmd)\\\n    In this section we will examine whether the effects of fishing are affected by different parameters in the model that are affected by the environment, such as the amount of food available at the base of the food web, which is set by the amount of resources you have added in your model. For those wishing to go further, we will provide you with information on how you could take this example further by forcing the models with climate change scenarios through time.\n\n#To get your worksheet repository for this week, follow this link: \\#<https://classroom.github.com/xxx>\n\n",
