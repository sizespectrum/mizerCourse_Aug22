This conversion of energy invested into reproduction into egg biomass is inefficient. Firstly much energy is spent on things like migration to spawning grounds, rather than on production of gonadic mass. Secondly, only a small proportion of eggs that are produced are viable and hatch into larvae.\nIn order for the population to be at steady state, the reproductive efficiency has to have a particular value. If it were higher, the population would increase, if it was lower, the population would decrease with time. The steady() function has set the reproductive efficiency to just the right value to maintain the population level and has stored it in the species parameter called erepro.\n\n\n[1] 0.899483\n\n\nThe model with the changed maturity curve leads to a different rate of investment into reproduction and thus needs a slightly different reproductive efficiency to remain at steady state:\n\n\n[1] 0.8894015\n\n\nThis is the reproductive efficiency at steady state. When the population deviates from the steady state, for example due to a change in fishing, the reproductive efficiency can be set to change according to a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment curve.

    "text": "How predation is modelled\nThe easiest case in which to understand predation is to imagine a filter feeding fish, swimming around with its mouth open. Clearly the amount of food it takes in is determined by four things:\n\nthe density of prey in the water,\nhow much volume of water the fish is able to filter, which will depend on how fast it swims as well as on its gape size.\nwhat sizes of prey the fish is able to filter out of the water, which will be limited by its gape size and by how fine its gill rakers are,\nhow fast it can digest the food. If it can filter the prey faster than it can digest, it will have to start letting prey go uneaten.\n\nFor a more active hunter the situation will be similar. The rate at which it predates will depend on four things:\n\nthe density of prey in the water\nthe volume of water that the fish patrols and in which it will be able to seek out its prey. This may depend on things like radius of vision.\nwhich of this detected prey the fish is able to catch, which will depend on its mouth size but also on its agility and skill as well as on the defensive mechanisms of the prey.\nhow fast it can digest the food.\n\nOf these four factors, we have of course already been discussing the density of prey. In the next section we will discuss the ability to filter out or catch prey of particular sizes, which we model via the predation kernel. In the section after that we will discuss the search volume and then in the following section the maximum consumption rate."

    "text": "The predation kernel\nFish will be particularly good at catching prey in a specific range of sizes, smaller than themselves. This is encoded in the size-spectrum model by the predation kernel. Let us take a look at the predation kernel in our model. We can obtain it with the function getPredKernel().\n\n\n\nThis is a large three-dimensional array (predator species x predator size x prey size). We extract the kernel of a predator of size 10g (using that we remember that this is in size class 81)\n\n\n\nThe drop = FALSE option is there to prevent R from dropping any of the array dimensions. We can now plot this as usual\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the predator of size 10g likes to feed on prey that is about a factor 100 smaller than itself, but also feeds on other sizes, just with reduced preference. The preferred predator/prey size ratio is determined by the species parameter beta and the width of the feeding kernel, i.e., how fussy the predator is regarding their prey size, is determined by the species parameter sigma. In our model these have the values\n\n\n               beta sigma\nTarget species  100   1.3\n\n\nLet us change the preferred predator/prey mass ratio from 100 to 1000. As usual, we first create a copy of the parameter object, then we make the change in that copy.\n\n\n\nLet’s make a plot to see that the predation kernel has indeed changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we now again reduce the prey in the size range from 1mg to 10mg as before, we now expect this to produce a peak in the biomass spectrum somewhere between 1g and 10g. Let’s check.\n\n\nConvergence was achieved in 4.5 years.\n\n\nWarning in setBevertonHolt(params, reproduction_level = old_reproduction_level):\nThe following species require an unrealistic reproductive efficiency greater\nthan 1: Target species\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, as expected.\nFor details of how beta and sigma parametrise the predation kernel, see https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/lognormal_pred_kernel.html#details. For information on how to change the predation kernel, see https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/setPredKernel.html#setting-predation-kernel\nIt is very important not to confuse the prey preference with the diet. Just because a predator might prefer to feed on prey of a particular size if it had free choice does not mean that it actually feeds predominantly on such prey. The actual diet of the fish depends also on the availability of prey. Because smaller prey are more abundant, the realised predator/prey mass ratio in the diet will be smaller than the preferred predator/prey mass ratio. This is particularly important when estimating the predation kernel from stomach data.\n\nExercise 6\nChange the parameters of the predation kernel to beta = 50 and sigma = 2 and plot the predation kernel of a predator of size 1g. You should see that the predation kernel is truncated so that the predator never feeds on prey larger than themselves.\n\n\nNext, plot the steady state arising with this feeding kernel when the prey abundance is artificially reduced by a factor of 10 in the size range between 1mg and 10mg as in previous examples. What do you observe? Are you surprised?"

This is difficult to model from first principles, although people have tried to argue in terms of swimming speeds of fish. We assume that this search volume rate is also an allometric rate. Let \\gamma(w) denote this rate for a predator of size w. Thus we assume that \\gamma(w) = \\gamma_0\\ w^q for some exponent q. We know that a fish needs to consume prey at a rate that scales with its body size to the power p, with p about 3/4. We also know that the prey density will be approximately described by the Sheldon power law, i.e., that N(w) = N_0\\ w^{-\\lambda}. A bit of maths then says that q = 2 - \\lambda + n. This explains the message you got when you created the params object with a certain choice of \\lambda: mizer chose the search volume exponent automatically according to this formula. In the real world, evolution will have made sure that the fish will have developed a feeding strategy that allows it to cover its metabolic costs, and thus leads to that search volume exponent of q. Clearly, filter feeders have taken a very different route to this than forage fish, but the result is the same.\nLet us see what effect changing the coefficient \\gamma_0 in the search volume rate has.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Mizer is a tool that can be used to simulate a dynamic size spectrum in an marine ecosystem, subject to changes through time, such as fishing pressure. Multiple interacting species and fishing gears can be defined allowing for a range of fisheries management strategy scenarios, and their ecosystem impacts, to be tested.\nBelow we explore some examples of what can be done using a previously calibrated mizer model. We will use the mizerHowTo package which contains some handy functions for this example.\n\n\n\nIn the previous tutorials we have been focused on the steady state. Now we are ready to make changes through time by forcing the model away from its steady state. For this example, will start with the toothfish model but as always you can you your own model or the curonian lagoon for the exercises.\n\nIn the previous tutorial, we examined a simple longline fishery that consists of targeting a single species (toothfish, here referred to as D.ele). However, all of the parameters for fishing were fixed through time. Mizer can also be used to carry out projections with changes in fishing effort.\nWe will start by reading in a time series of catch and effort.\n\n# read in model sim object\nsim <- readRDS(\"toothfish/params10.RDS\")\nparams <- sim@params\n\n# read in fishing data (note: these are not really correct values, they are only for illustration in this example) \n\ndat<-readRDS(\"toothfish/longline.rds\")\n\nplot_dat <- reshape2::melt(dat, \"Year\")\nggplot(plot_dat, aes(x = Year, y = value)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_wrap(~variable, nrow = 2, scales = \"free\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can see from the data that there have been big changes in effort and catches through time. The three plots show effort in units of number of hooks, catches are in tonnes, and the final plot shows how the area of the fishing activity has expanded through time.\nPreviously we assumed effort was 1 and we worked with catchability as the variable. Real effort data can come in all sorts of different units (hours or days fished, kilowatt days, number of vessels all per unit time). The key to using this in our model is that the catchability is the fraction of the available (that is also selected by the gear) stock caught per unit of any effort that is included.\nOften, we have used fishing mortality rates from stock assessment to drive changes in effort through time, assuming Q*E = F at maximally selected sizes (as in this paper and others). But in many cases this information is not available. It also could be misleading as those fishing mortality rates are estimated using very different single-species models (but sometimes that is the best we have to work with, and as with all of the assumptions we make the limitations just need to be clear).\nHow do we incorporate the effort data into the model? First, we have to re-arrange the data so it can be read into the param object.\n\nspecies_params(params)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\neffort_time <-array(c(rep(0,53),dat$EffortPerArea), dim = c(length(1950:2020),1),dimnames = list(\"time\" = 1950:2020, \"gear\" = params@gear_params$gear[1]))\n\nNext we use the effort data to project the model forwards from it’s steady state. But wait - we did not set up the model for the first year of the data, when fishing only just began. It may make more sense to use a steady state without fishing as the initial values for our projection.\n\nsim0 <- projectToSteady(params, effort = 0, return_sim = TRUE, t_max = 200)\n\nConvergence was achieved in 1.5 years.\n\nparams<-setInitialValues(params,sim0)\n\n\nsimf <- project(params, effort = effort_time)\n\nyieldplot<-plotYieldGear(simf)\n\nyieldcompare<-yieldplot+ geom_point(data = dat, shape = 1, size = 1, mapping = aes(x=Year, y= CatchPerArea))\nyieldcompare\n\n\n\n\nHere we can see that the modeled catch time series fall within the scatter of the observed catch data (reassuring), but the trends are different. It seems there is a sharp decline in modeled catches towards the end of the time series. While we should not expect the exact up and down fluctuations to be captured by our model (we don’t have anything forcing the changes through time other than fishing!), we can examine how changing the reproduction parameters affects how well the model captures stock decline (and later, recovery), relative to the trends in the data.\nWe can look at this below by changing the reproduction level and seeing what the levels of sustainable fishing mortality the equilibrium yield vs F curves suggest for different assumptions (where the peak occurs we could consider a proxy for single-species Fmsy) .\n\nparams2<- setBevertonHolt(params, reproduction_level = 0.2)\n\nsim02 <- projectToSteady(params2, effort = 0, return_sim = TRUE, t_max = 200)\n\nConvergence was achieved in 1.5 years.\n\nplotYieldVsF(params2,species=\"D.ele\")\n\nConvergence was achieved in 1.5 years.\n\n\nWarning in projectToSteady(params, t_max = 100, return_sim = TRUE, progress_bar\n= FALSE, : D.ele are going extinct.\n\n\nSimulation run did not converge after 90 years.

These different types of development can be represented by a function, effort_dynamics(), and can be used to help estimate the fishing parameters given the the model parameters and data you may have. This is the approach used here. Here, we will use this function to explore effort through time.\n\n# should I move to helper_functions or leave it in?\n\neffort_dynamics<-function(effort_array, gear=\"longline\",time=1950:2020,Fmax=1.5,steepness=0.2,midpoint=2005){\n\neffort_array[,gear]<-Fmax/(1+ exp(-steepness*(time - midpoint)))\n\nreturn(effort_array)\n}\n\nneweffort<-effort_dynamics(effort_time,Fmax=2.0,steepness=0.2,midpoint=2003)\n\n# to scale this up to the effort and catchability we used in our model we can multiply by initial effort \n\nneweffort<-neweffort*sim@params@initial_effort\n\nyear=1950:2020\nplot(year,neweffort,typ=\"l\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat level of Fmax causes collapse? Is this consistent with the knowledge form the equilibrium yield curves (sensitivity to fishing tutorial)?\n\nSet up another gear or a bycatch on on other the other species - follow same effort but with a lower catchability.\n[need to add]\n\n[in prep]\nIf you are interested in how to statistically fit models to time series data the mizerHowTo package discusses this (still in preparation).\nNext we will investigate dynamical changes in environment, with a focus on changes in resource abundance and size structure."
