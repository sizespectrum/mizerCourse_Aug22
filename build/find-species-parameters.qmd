title: "Finding species parameters"
---

Here you will learn how to find appropriate values for the species parameters needed to set up your own mizer model.

## Selecting model species

How do we decide which species to include in the model? There are many ways to approach it and no clearly set rules. Of course you want to include species that you are interested in, but then also perhaps some other important species in the ecosystem. Mizer actually has a powerful framework that allows you to explicitly model only your focus species and represent the rest of the ecosystem with some 'background' species. The sizes and abundances of these 'background' species are assumed to follow the power law, so that the total community biomass approximately represents the Sheldon spectrum. This is only mentioned here for your information, as we will not go into these details during this week.

If you have your own ecosystem that you want to model during this week, then you also have your own list of species. Ideally you may want to have somewhere around 4 to 20 species, as this allows for interesting but also tractable dynamics (although tracking processes in all 20 species might be quite challenging). For the Curonian Lagoon model we selected key ecosystem fish species that are commonly observed in scientific monitoring surveys, and which live and reproduce in the ecosystem (as compared to several migratory species, which can be abundant briefly but do not have a big role in the ecosystem). The list of species and their general feeding habits or trophic group are listed below. We include scientific and model name, the latter representing a short name that we can conveniently use and display in plots.

| Scientific name                        | Model name | Trophic group |
|----------------------------------------|------------|---------------|
| Pungitius pungitius, Alburnus alburnus | smallfish  | planktivore   |
| Gymnocephalus cernua                   | ruffe      | benthivore    |
| Abramis brama, Blicca bjoerkna         | breams     | benthivore    |
| Rutillus rutillus                      | roach      | benthivore    |
| Vimba vimba                            | vimba      | benthivore    |
| Carassius carassius                    | carassius  | benthivore    |
| Perca fluviatilis                      | perch      | omnivore      |
| Sander lucioperca                      | pikeperch  | predator      |
| Lota lota                              | burbot     | predator      |
| Esox lucius, Aspius aspius             | predators  | predator      |

## Essential parameters

At this point it might be useful to go back and rewatch the second half of Ken Andersen's introductory lecture, which explains species parameters used in mizer. It is great how mizer can start building a model with only very few species parameters! For many parameters, if values are not supplied by the user, mizer can fill them with default values using size-based theory or species averages. However, there are several parameters that the user must provide for the model species:

1.  Asymptotic body size `w_inf`

2.  Von-Bertalanffy growth rate `k_vb` or species maximum intake rate coefficient `h` Even if you provide `h` values, you might still want to include `k_vb` in your species parameter file, because it is currently used to plot modelled versus expected growth rates (although mizer will soon allow plotting multiple observations of size at age to highlight the fact that species growth trajectory can vary and is not a fixed line)

3.  Predator-prey mass ratio `beta`

4.  A vector of species biomasses to be provided in the `biomass_observed` column. This vector represents average species biomasses in your model system. The units of the area or volume over which these biomasses were observed depend on your choice, mizer does not care about it (see section [Units in mizer](https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/setParams.html#setting-search-volume) in this reference page). Note that here we will also need average biomass values, not time series of observations. These values could be derived from scientific surveys, catches, underwater surveys or similar sources. If you do not know how to scale these values to volume or model area, just use relative biomasses. The goal is to get relative species biomases and abundances in the right magnitude.

    Below is a summary of key parameters

> ### Von Bertalanffy Growth Function
>
> The growth curve of a fish is commonly reported as a von Bertalanffy growth curve. The von Bertalanffy curve describes the length of a fish as a function of two parameters; the asymptotic length $L_\infty$ and the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient $K$ (`k_vb` in mizer): $$ L_{(t)} = L_\infty (1-e^{-Kt}) $$ where $t$ is the age. $L_\infty$ represents the asymptotic length and $1/K$ is approximately the age at maturation. Mizer, however, uses two other parameters, $W_\infty$ (`w_inf` in Mizer) and $h$, where $W_\infty$ represents the asymptotic weight and $h$ the size-scaled maximum consumption rate. Fortunately, the two sets of parameters are related, and one can derive $h$ and $W_\infty$ from von Bertalanffy $K$ and $L_\infty$.

> The parameter $h$ represents the maximum consumption rate of a fish, scaled by size. The value of $h$ varies between 4 -- 400, with a geometric mean around 22 g$^{-0.25}$/year across all fish species (Andersen 2019, chap. 2 and 11). The figure above however suggest an average value of 40 g$^{-0.25}$/year, so this indicates that there is quite a bit of uncertainty associated with the default value to use. A more precise estimate can be obtained from von Bertalanffy $K$ and $L_\infty$ as: $h \approx 4.75 K\cdot L_\infty^{0.75}$ (with $K$ given in 1/years and $L_\infty$ in cm).

## Other species parameters

There are many other parameters that are used to describe species properties, but mizer has default ways to calculate them based on the size theory expectations. You can read about the theory in various publications or in the excellent Ken H Andersen book ["Fish Ecology, Evolution, and Exploitation" (2019)](https://ken.haste.dk/home/publications).

The parameter with default values are:

6.  Maturation body size `w_mat` Usually you would want to set them up yourself from life-history data, but if no data is available mizer will use 0.25 \* `w_inf`

7.  Species feeding or satiation level at larval stage `f0` If no value is provided mizer assumes 0.6.

8.  Species critical feeding level, or feeding level at which energy intake is equal to meatoblic (maintenance) expenditure `fc`. If no value is provided mizer assumes 0.2.

9.  Parameter defining the width of the predation kernel `sigma` If no value is provided mizer will use a default value of 2 (which is actually a very wide kernel).

10. Species search volume constant `gamma` and its body size scaling exponent `q` If no values are provided the `gamma` and `q` are set so that when prey abundance is described by the power law with the exponent `lambda`, food search rate will lead to the feeding level `f0`.

11. Species maximum intake rate constant `h` and its body size scaling exponent `n` If no value is provided the coefficient `h` is set so as to achieve Von-Bertalanffy growth rates (given the feeding level `f0`). The exponent `n` is by default set to 2/3.

12. Species metabolic rate constants `ks` and its body size scaling exponent `p` If no values are provided the coefficient `ks` is set so that at maturation size metabolic expenditure requires `fc` (critical feeding) level of maximum intake. The exponent `p` by default is set at 0.7. You can also include species activity coefficient `k` which scales linearly with body size (exponent of 1). By default this value is set to 0 and most mizer models do not include it.

13. Species food assimilation efficiency `alpha` If no value is provided mizer assumes 0.6

14. Species minimum body size in the model `w_min` If no value is provided mizer assumes 0.001

15. Species external (also called background or baseline) size-independent mortality rate constant `z0` This parameter determines the background mortality that affects all species size classes in the same way (it is a flat rate across sizes). If no values are provided mizer assumes that species with small maximum body sizes have much higher baseline mortality rate (e.g. a species with `w_inf` = 35 g will have `z0` = 0.18, a species with `w_inf` = 150g will have `z0` = 0.11 and a species with `w_inf` = 14kg will have `z0` = 0.025.

16. Species reproduction parameters `R_max` and `erepro`. They are derived based on a steady state and observed biomases, but their adjustment is an important part of model parameterisation. We will talk about them in later tutorials.

17. Species length-weight conversion coefficients `a` and `b` These coefficients are only needed if maximum or maturation body size are provided in length.

> ### Length-weight regression
>
> The asymptotic length and weight are related as: $$W_\infty = a \cdot L_\infty^b$$ Species-specific conversion coefficients $a$ and $b$ are available on FishBase. If no data is avaialbe for your specific species, reasonable general values are: $a = 0.01\ \mathrm{g/cm}^{-3}$ and $b = 3$.

Note that all of the default values can be changed by the user. If you feel you need more advanced reading you can explore it [here](https://sizespectrum.org/mizer/reference/setParams.html)

## Exercise 1: collecting species parameters from FishBase

Now our goal is to set up species parameter data frame. For that we need to go to FishBase, look up our model species and find their essential parameters. Make sure you check all the different sources of information that FishBase has. Scroll all the way down to "More information" section and explore Length-weight, Fecundity, Age/size, Food items, Diet and especially Growth sections. From this select the best parameters for the species and save them in a csv file dataframe, available with your exercise worksheets. You can fill only those parameters that you think are essential (e.g. you can fill both `k_vb` and `h` or just one of them).

Note, you will not be able to find predation kernel parameters of `beta` and `sigma` on FishBase. So use knowledge you have gained so far to make an approximate guess. Also pay attention to the species trophic groups. Species that are benthivores do not actually feed on other fish, but on small benthic invertebrates. You can check that in the Diet and Food items section in FishBase or from general knowledge. For benthivorous and planktivorous species `beta` values will be much larger (i.e. prey is relatively smaller) than for predators. For example, a 500g bream is feeding on small invertebrates, like amphipods. If we use the generic length-weight conversion then a 5mm (0.5cm) amphipod will weigh 0.01\*0.5\^3 = 0.00125 grams. This will give you a general idea about the approximate `beta` values for benthivorous fish.

**ASTA - we need to give the participants the file /experiment/species_params_exercise.csv which they will have to fill**

Important!

TODO: Asta make a note about different exponents and why different defaults are used, and the fact that this is not settled

## Species interaction matrix 

The next thing we will need to provide to mizer is species interaction matrix. This matrix can include three different aspects (or a combination of all of them):

1.  **Spatial and temporal overlap of species in a large ecosystem**. This way the interaction matrix is set based on e.g. species occurrences in various fisheries surveys or observations and reflect the frequency of how often same species are found in same surveys. This is how species interactions are set up in the example [North Sea model](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2664.12238), which comes with mizer installation.

    ```{r}
    library(mizerExperimental)

    Gustav - how do I access North Sea interaction matrix and display it here??


    ```

2.  **Species diet preferences** **or trophic groups**. Sometimes we know that certain species do not eat other species. For example, some species are strictly bentivorous or herbivorous and they never eat any other fish, not even their larvae. In other cases we might have good evidence for specific diet preferences, although ideally such evidence should come from food selection experiments and these are very rare and maybe too specific to certain conditions. It is important to know that diet contents do not necessarily reflect preferences, but realised feeding. A species might prefer to eat bananas, but if nothing else is available it will eat other fish. The species interaction matrix, if reflecting diet preferences, should reflect preferred diets, not realised diets.

3.  **Species antipredatory behaviour or vulnerability**. Some species may simply be less available to other species because they are good at hiding, have spikes, or live in large schools which reduces their vulnerability to predation compared to solitary species. This could also be included in the species interaction matrix, but in the prey column.

    For our Curonian lagoon example we used existing ecological knowledge and set up species interaction matrix as follows:

    ```{r}

    load csv
    display interaction matrix in some nice way
    ```

TODO: brief explanation why this interaction matrix is set in this way
