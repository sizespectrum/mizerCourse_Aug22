## Size based ecosystem models with the R package mizer and applications for coastal and inland ecosystems

In this online course you will learn about the principles of size based community and ecosystem modelling, implementation of these principles in the R package mizer, learn about adaptation of mizer for shallow ecosystems with multiple resources, and learn how to build a new model with your own or example data and use it to investigate the ecosystem effect of changes in fishing or other stressors.

The course is led by Gustav Delius (University of York, UK) and Asta Audzijonyte (Nature Research Centre, Lithuania & University of Tasmania, Australia), with technical support by Romain Forestier (University of Tasmania). Invited speakers include Ken Haste Andersen and Julia Blanchard.

Participation is free. If you would like to participate in this course, please [register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLGJfGQ1IBa5ZozqWTGIXX17xF73kPHKYhAFFa0H2nn4CT4Q/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0).

## Tutorials and worksheets

The course has three week-long sections:

-   **Week 1: Understand**\
    You will gain an understanding of size spectra and their dynamics by exploring simple example systems hands-on with mizer.

-   **Week 2: Build**\
    Following our example, you will build your own multi-species mizer model for the Curonian sea. We will collect the models from all participants to create an ensemble of models.

-   **Week 3: Use**\
    We will use this new ensemble of mizer models to explore the effects of changes in fishing and changes in resource dynamics. You will run your own model scenarios.

The course is organised into several tutorials each week. Each tutorial is associated with a worksheet in which you perform the exercises that are dotted throughout the tutorials. You will work through these tutorials and worksheets at times that are convenient for you.

## On-line meetings

There will be several optional online meeting scheduled throughout the course, see the list of meetings in the table below. The purpose of the meetings is to add a social dimension to the course. You only have to join when you can. For each day we organise two meetings to accommodate different time zones:

-   7am UK summer time (BST) most suitable for Asia and Australasia:\

Please follow one of these links now. You will be asked to create yourself an account. Please use the email address that you used for registering for this mizer course. If you need to use another email address, please send an email from that email address to [gustav.delius\@gmail.com](mailto:gustav.delius@gmail.com) and he will add that email to the list of accepted emails.

Once you have logged into Remo, you will be introduced to its main features and then Remo will check whether your browser and operating system is on their list of supported configurations.

Do not worry if you get the message that your configuration is not supported. It will most likely work anyway.

When you get to the landings page for the meeting, click on "Register for Event". You will only need to do this once. All future meetings will use the same meeting space.

On Monday **8th of August** we will have an introductory and welcome meeting with all course participants. On Tuesdays and Thursdays of each week course participants are encouraged to join the meetings with other course participants to discuss their progress, challenges and ideas (course tutors will not attend all these meetings). On Fridays we will have meetings with tutors to recap the experience from that week and discuss remaining questions.
