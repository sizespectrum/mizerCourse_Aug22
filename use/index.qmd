title: "Week 3: Use mizer models"
---

Now that you have a built and examined your model at steady state, this week we will explore changing conditions and temporal dynamics. We will first use an example to describe how to run your model with changing fishing, as well show how some of the outputs of the model can be analysed. Then you can use your model examine the consequences of simple changes in both resources and fishing.


The material is split into 4 tutorials:

1.  [**Tuning the sensitivity to fishing**](tune-sensitivity.qmd)\
    Here we will explore how sensitive your model is to the effects of fishing. As usual, we will start with an example system. We will show how the reproduction parameters influence how sensitive the model is to changes in mortality. We can make adjustments and refinements at this step if the model does not produce realistic responses to fishing intensity.

2.  [**Simulating and examining changes**](simulate-change.qmd)\
    Once the sensitivity to fishing is examine, we can assess hwo the model responds to changes in fishing through time. This step involves looking a bot closer at the fishing parameters in mizer and setting up a time-varying fishing effort.  In this part we will start with an example that will show you how to run a model through a time series and compare it with data. You will then set up your own fishing parameters that you can use in your own scenarios below. 

3.  [**Run your own scenarios**](run-your-own-scenari.qmd)\
    In this tutorial we will explore how to set up your own fishing experiments and scenarios. These can be scenarios that compare different levels of fishing (at steady steady) or a comparison of different future scenario projections, where fishing changes through time.

4.  [**Sensitivity to changes in resources**](change-resources.qmd)\
    In this section we will examine whether the effects of fishing are affected by different parameters in the model that are affected by the environment, such as the amount of food available at the base of the food web, which is set by the amount of resources you have added in your model. We will also show you how you could take this example further by changing the resource through time.
