title: "Week 3: Use mizer models"
---

Now that you have a built and examined your model at steady state, we will explore changing conditions and temporal dynamics. We will first use an example to describe how to run your model with changing fishing, as well show how some of the outputs of the model can be analysed. Then you can use your model examine the consequences of simple changes in fishing scenarios and background resources.

### Lecture

This week's contributor is Julia Blanchard. Her lecture provides a broad overview of the different ways in which mizer is being used to help understand the consequences of change in aquatic ecosystems. There are a lot of ways! The material describes how you can set model simulations to study change, some of which are explored in further detail below.

### Tutorials

Using examples, the tutorials are designed to help you develop your own model simulation experiments, in the following four stages:

1.  [**Tuning the sensitivity to fishing**](tune-sensitivity.qmd)\
    First, we will explore how sensitive your model is to the effects of fishing. As usual, we will start with an example system. We will show how the reproduction parameters influence how sensitive the model is to changes in mortality. We can make adjustments and refinements at this step if the model does not produce realistic responses to fishing intensity.

2.  [**Simulating and examining changes**](simulate-change.qmd)\
    Once the sensitivity to fishing is examined, we can assess how the model responds to changes in fishing through time. This step involves looking closer at the fishing parameters in mizer and setting up different fishing scenarios. 
    
3.  [**Changing resources**](change-resources.qmd)\
    Now we will look at the resource spectrum and how changes in three main resource parameters can affect our ecosystem. With three main parameters for each resource, this can quickly get complicated. We will also show an example of how to force time series of resource using external data. 

4.  [**Explore further scenarios**](run-your-own-scenarios.qmd)\
    This tutorial provides extra material, prepared by Julia Blanchard using another system (Patagonian toothfish fishery) as an example. Here you can learn on how to set time series of fishing changes and more.
