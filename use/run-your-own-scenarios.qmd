title: "Run your own scenarios"
---

## In preparation

NOTES: 

Develop your own scenarios. 

Changes through time


- Try different resource / fishing scenarios... 
- Could talk thorugh temperature

Comparison at steady state 

If you do not have time series you could alternatively design a similar experiment involving scenarios that do not have time series at steady state -  just the % change by some period (drawing from lit). 

For example - baseline , with catchability and Effort equal ( or F = 2 or at Fmsy) if you donâ€™t have catch data 

Increase/decrease resource 1 kappa
Increase/decrease resource 1 lambda 
Increase/decrease resource 2 lambda
Increase/decrease fishing effort and/or size at selectivity
