title: "Change resources"
---

## In preparation


-simple example showing effect of two different states - e.g. change in resource slopes and intercepts on steady states?


NOTES: 
3. Change Resources 
-Plankton over time - resource_dynamics 

Project the above scenario holding effort constant 

Can directly use outputs of earth system models for projections (GFDL inputs - FishMIP), to easily show you what functions to work we will use 2 stylised scenarios that you can adapt and explore for your own model scenarios.

If you wish to participate in FishMIP, we  provide inputs of ocean physical & bc variables to modellers.

trend - X% decline per year, lambda and X% 

(Add noise ?)

Exercise - try creating  running your own scenarios - with and without fishing -how do changes in resource affect the catches abs biomass compared to the baseline (no change in resources scenario) . How does biomass change with & without fishing under the scenarios
