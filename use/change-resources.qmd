title: "Change resources"
---

## In preparation

-could add example showing changes through time - e.g. thermizer example with climate change forcing.

-or an example with seasonal / stochastic resource dynamics

-or simpler example showing effect of two different states - e.g. change in resource slopes and intercepts on steady states?
