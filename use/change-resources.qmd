title: "Change resources"

## Introduction

Mizer can be used to explore the consequences of climate change on aquatic ecosystems and fisheries. One of the major effects that climate change is having on aquatic ecosystems is through changes in plankton and benthos abundance and size structure. However, responses in resources are highly uncertain and variable and predictions are difficult. For plankton we can use satellite observations of chlorophyl A and earth system models to assess past changes and aim to predict the future. Benthos changes also are likely having large impacts on shallow water ecosystems, but in many cases we have almost no empirical data on how much change is happening. Nevertheless we might want to explore the potential effect of these changes on the rest of aquatic food webs and on our fisheries. This is what we are going to do in this tutorial.
